# Hotel Reservation Application

## Overview

The Hotel Reservation Application is a comprehensive project designed to manage hotel reservations with enhanced features such as localization, internationalization, multithreading, and Docker containerization. This application is developed using Java with the Spring Framework for the backend, and Angular for the frontend, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture.

## Project Description

This application was developed as part of a software development course to meet new requirements under new management for the Landon Hotel scheduling application. The project includes various functionalities such as displaying welcome messages in multiple languages, showing prices in different currencies, and displaying times for events in various time zones. The project is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

### Key Features

1. **Multithreaded Localization and Internationalization**:
   - The application displays a welcome message in both English and French using resource bundles.
   - Each language's welcome message is displayed using a different thread to demonstrate multithreading.

2. **Currency Display**:
   - The front end displays the price for a reservation in U.S. dollars ($), Canadian dollars (C$), and euros (â‚¬) on different lines.

3. **Time Zone Conversion**:
   - A Java method converts times between Eastern Time (ET), Mountain Time (MT), and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
   - The application displays a message showing the time for an online live presentation in all three time zones.

4. **Docker Containerization**:
   - The application is containerized using Docker.
   - A Dockerfile is provided to create a single image that includes all code and modifications.
   - Instructions and a screenshot for running the Docker image in a container are provided.

### Technologies Used

- **Spring Framework**: For building the Java backend.
- **Angular**: For the front-end interface.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For interacting with the relational database.
- **MySQL**: As the database to store reservation data.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing the application.
- **Lombok**: To reduce boilerplate code in Java.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.

### How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mmoffett02/Hotel-Reservation-Application.git
   cd Hotel-Reservation-Application
Set Up the Database:

Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
Create a database named hotel_reservation.
Configure the Application:

Update the application.properties file with your database connection details.
Run the Application:


./mvnw spring-boot:run
Access the Front End:

Open your browser and navigate to the front-end URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
How to Run the Docker Container
Build the Docker Image:


docker build -t hotel-reservation-application .
Run the Docker Container:


docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name D387_[student ID] hotel-reservation-application
Access the Application:

Open your browser and navigate to the front-end URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
Cloud Deployment
To deploy the current multithreaded Spring application to the cloud, the following steps can be taken:

Choose a Cloud Service Provider:

Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.
Set Up a Cloud Environment:

Create an account and set up a virtual machine or container service (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, or Azure Container Instances).
Deploy the Docker Container:

Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCP Container Registry).
Pull the Docker image in the cloud environment and run it.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to develop and customize a hotel reservation application using modern frameworks and technologies, including Spring, Angular, and Docker. It showcases skills in both front-end and back-end development, multithreading, and containerization, making it a valuable addition to any developer's portfolio.
